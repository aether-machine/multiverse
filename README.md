# universe-as-diode

A research starter: *The Universe as a Diode Junction* — a coherence-first toy framework that models universes as coupled oscillatory elements in a biased transmission medium. This repo contains code, a short technical draft, and simulation tools to reproduce the basic Stuart–Landau toy model demonstrating cross-rail coherence locking.

**Purpose.**  
Provide a concise, reproducible proof-of-concept for mutual reinforcement of a "life-signal" across three coupled bias rails (Light, Our, Dark) using coupled limit-cycle oscillators. The minimal model shows phase/amplitude locking and gives a mathematical shorthand for thinking of a universe as a diode-like junction within a larger meta-circuit.

## Quickstart

1. Clone & enter the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aether-machine/universe-as-diode.git
cd universe-as-diode```

2. Create & activate a Python virtual environment, install requirements:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt```

3. Run the example simulation:
```bash
python sim/run_simulation.py```

This will create results/coherence_locking.png (amplitude traces + global coherence) and print run parameters.

Files of interest

-sim/coupled_oscillators.py: numerical model (Stuart–Landau + configurable asymmetric coupling) and helpers.

-sim/run_simulation.py: example driver, default parameters reproduce the toy run.

-paper/universe_diode.md: technical note (suitable for Substack or initial whitepaper).

-results/: output images.

Reuse & next steps

- Turn interactive_model.ipynb into a demo with sliders (energy, coupling, diode thresholds).

- Sweep parameter grids and produce heatmaps (regions of locking / bifurcation).

- Add gated coupling (diode thresholds), state-dependent couplings, or extend to larger N networks.
