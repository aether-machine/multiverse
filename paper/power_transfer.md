# Maximum Power Transfer Theorem for Life in the Multiverse

## 1. Motivation
In electronics, the **Maximum Power Transfer Theorem (MPTT)** states that a source delivers maximum power to a load when the load impedance matches the source impedance (complex conjugate matching in AC).  

By analogy, in the multiverse framework:  
- The **life signal** is the flowing coherence sustained across universes.  
- **Matter and organisms** act as “loads” that couple to this coherence.  
- The conditions for sustaining life may be governed by a resonance-like matching between local impedance (matter/biology) and the global coherence field (spacetime bias).

## 2. Statement of Theorem
**Life extracts maximum coherence-energy from the multiverse when the effective impedance of the organism matches the impedance of its cosmic environment.**

Formally:
\[
P_{\text{life}} \propto \frac{V^2 R_{\text{match}}}{(R_{\text{env}} + R_{\text{org}})^2 + (X_{\text{env}} - X_{\text{org}})^2}
\]

- \(R_{\text{env}}, X_{\text{env}}\): real and imaginary parts of the environmental impedance  
- \(R_{\text{org}}, X_{\text{org}}\): real and imaginary parts of the organism’s impedance  
- Matching requires \(R_{\text{org}} = R_{\text{env}}\) and \(X_{\text{org}} = -X_{\text{env}}\)

## 3. Biological / Cosmic Interpretations
- **Metabolism** = local resistance (dissipative matching to universal flow)  
- **Consciousness** = reactive matching (phase alignment, minimizing mismatch)  
- **Evolution** = adaptation toward impedance-matched resonance with the cosmic field  
- **Death** = decoupling due to mismatch, where coherence can no longer be drawn  

---

## 4. Predictions
- Stable ecosystems represent **matched networks** where energy and information flow optimally.  
- Evolutionary “jumps” may correspond to **impedance re-tunings**.  
- Civilizational collapse may occur when environmental impedance drifts beyond adaptive match.  

---

## 5. Experimental Outlook
- **Analog simulation**: nonlinear oscillator chains tuned to maximize power transfer under impedance constraints.  
- **Biological analogy**: metabolic efficiency correlating with environmental impedance (temperature, radiation, nutrient flux).  
- **Cosmological analogy**: dark energy profile as the global “impedance curve” of spacetime.

## 6. Closing Remark
This theorem reframes life not as a random accident, but as a natural consequence of **impedance matching in a multiverse circuit** — coherence flows wherever the match is right.
